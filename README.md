# PortScanner
Port Scanning using Python without NMAP modules.

This is a python project that I did to automate my work. I was curious to see how I could achieve port scanning functionality without using any of the NMAP modules.

Although it might not be as efficient as using the NMAP modules, the SOCKET modules would do the trick just fine if your only goal is to scan active/open ports.
